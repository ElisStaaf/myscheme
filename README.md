# MyScheme
MyScheme is a Scheme interpreter that... Definitely exists, alright.
It gets the basics done but it doesn't include *everything*, per se.
But if you want to, you could install it, I guess.

## Install
```console
git clone https://github.com/ElisStaaf/myscheme scm
cd scm
sudo make
```

## Run
```console
myscm <args>
```

## Further help
Open the repl in the source
directory by running `myscm`
with 0 arguments and type this:
```scm
(load "scheme/help.scm")
```
