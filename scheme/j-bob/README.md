# J-Bob
This is by far the biggest code example for
this entire language. It is almost 1k LOC. I
present to you; `J-Bob`.

## Who the fuck is J-Bob?
You might have asked. He is the code helper for
"the little prover" book written by Carl Eastlund
and Daniel P. Friedman. The proper license for this
folder is [here](https://github.com/ElisStaaf/MyScheme/blob/main/scheme/j-bob/LICENSE),
the MIT license.
